Lifting State up in react

Lifting up the State: As we know, every component in React has its own state. 
Because of this sometimes data can be redundant and inconsistent.
 So, by Lifting up the state we make the state of the parent component as a single source of truth and
  pass the data of the parent in its children.

  Time to use Lift up the State: If the data in “parent and children components” or in “cousin components” is Not in Sync.

Example 1: If we have 2 components in our App. A -> B where, A is parent of B. keeping the same data in both Component 
A and B might cause inconsistency of data.
